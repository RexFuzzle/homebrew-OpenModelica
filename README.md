## OpenModelica Homebrew Formula

This is a work in progress. It is currently set to the HEAD but at the last known version to compile of OSX.
There may very well be things that are installed that shouldn't be and so forth, but it is a work in progress and so far been able to reproduce compiling on my own machine and another clean osx and brew install.
Subversion is needed, but causes issues if added as a dependency.
Tests to be written soon.
To install:
```
brew install subversion
brew tap RexFuzzle/OpenModelica
brew install OpenModelica --HEAD
```
